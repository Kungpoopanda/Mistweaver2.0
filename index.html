      <h1>So you call yourself a healer? Pathetic.</h1>
      <p>
        Hey, <span class="healer">“healer.”</span> Newsflash: you’re not a
        healer — you’re a melee DPS whose green numbers are just collateral from
        actually hitting the boss. You’re basically a cleave spec with a
        first-aid kit duct-taped to it, and somehow you’ve still managed to
        convince yourself you’re the raid’s guardian angel. Spoiler: you’re not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, you thought you could handle a real class? Buckle up. The last
        mistweaver who tried raiding spent more time kissing the floor than
        hitting the boss. He quit after his first raid—at least he had the
        dignity to leave before embarrassing himself twice. You’ve got 15
        minutes to figure out how to stay on your feet, so go watch a Joardee
        boss guide before you trip over your own chi again.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know what’s killing your healing? It’s not the boss — it’s you not
        hitting the boss. You’re out here mashing Renewing Mist like it’s the
        nuclear launch code, wasting GCDs on wet-noodle heals while the rest of
        us are actually killing the thing that’s hurting people. The last
        mistweaver who tried this spent more time French-kissing the floor than
        doing damage. He quit after one raid night — and honestly, that’s the
        only decision he got right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tattoo your rotation on your forehead so when you’re staring into the
        mirror wondering where your hairline went, you’ll at least see one
        useful thing. Knowing you, though, you’d probably get it backwards and
        spend every evening before the raid squinting at your own forehead like
        a caveman reading hieroglyphs. So here you go, this is how you’d have to
        do it, dumbass.

      <p>
        And you’re still stacking Spirit, haste, and mastery like you’re
        following some half-baked sim? Really? Yeah, hit cap and haste cap
        matter — we all get it. The monk Discord will spoon-feed you those
        numbers in seconds. But the moment you actually have to think about what
        works in practice? That’s when your brain clocks out. You ignore how the
        spec feels to play because you don’t trust yourself — and honestly, you
        shouldn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, crit is king. But you? You refuse upgrades because “the stats
        aren’t perfect,” as if you’ve ever played perfectly in your life.
        Congrats — you’ve got the decision-making skills of a bag filled with
        rocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your raid is taking damage? That’s not your healing saving them — that’s
        fistweaving carrying you like a fireman hauling a drunk out of a burning
        tavern, while you waste GCDs on Renewing and Enveloping Mist like you’re
        sprinkling holy water on a sinking ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and Rushing Jade Wind? Stop. Speccing. Into. That. Skill. It’s not
        saving lives — it’s inflating your logs like a cheap blow-up doll while
        your raid is still dying. You could be running Xuen, pumping smart heals
        on people who matter and deleting boss HP at the same time. But no,
        you’d rather spin in place like a drunken panda pretending you’re saving
        the raid, while you’re really just jerking off to your HPS meter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cue the genius moment: “If fistweaving is so great, why not stop casting
        spells completely?” Oh, wow. Look at that galaxy brain. Did you think
        that up while collecting stacks from dancing on Will? Casting without
        fistweaving is like trying to cut an overcooked steak with a scalpel —
        it works, but you’re still going to look like an idiot for doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fistweaving works. Always. You weave in other Chi generators so you can
        blackout kick the boss’s teeth in if there’s more than one of them.
        They’re not for healing — they’re for damage. The healing is just
        collateral, the green splash from the crit you just slammed into the
        boss’s ribcage. Stop pretending it’s some big, noble act, you
        self-important Chi sprinkler.
